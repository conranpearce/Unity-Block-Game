# Unity Block Game WebGL

This repository is used to manage a website for a game I created using Unity and C#.
- The game can be found under [unity-block-game](https://github.com/conranpearce/unity-block-game) in my GitHub repositories.

## Deployment
- I have linked the GitHub respository to netlify for live deployment on the master branch.

- Live deployment of the game [here](https://unity-block-game.netlify.app/)
